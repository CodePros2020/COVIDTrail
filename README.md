  # COVIDTrail

## Objective / Goal 

Our team’s objective is to help the merchants adapt to some of the required changes that were put in place to fight against COVID 19. Contact tracing has emerged as one of the most effective public health tools to stop the transmission of COVID 19 1 . Our team would like to develop a mobile application that will simplify the process of getting information used for contact tracing for users and merchants. This application will also ensure that user’s personal contact information will only be exposed to public health officials.

## Business Case / Expected Impact

Contact tracing is done by getting the contact information, time, and date of people getting in their establishment. Some of the merchants are doing the process of contact tracing by manually writing the contact information on a sheet of paper. There are establishments who has a staff that is responsible for going around the establishment and asking about the contact information of the people entering and there are also establishments wherein they ask the customers to write their contact information.

Our team aims to create a solution that will simplify the process of contact tracing that will result to less contact between staff and customers, decrease the time in tracing the possible contacts of a person infected by COVID 19 that went into the establishment, increase the efficiency and productivity of the staff, and reduce the errors in getting the contact information.

## Assumptions

<ul>
  <li>Merchants have downloaded the application and registered the business name, location, and contact information. </li>
  <li>Merchants have printed the assigned QR code and posted the QR code in front of the door of the establishment. </li>
  <li>Users have downloaded the application and registered the contact name, location, and contact information. </li>
  <li>Users should have a camera on their mobile device that will allow them to scan the QR code in the app once they enter the establishment. </li>
</ul>

## Solution Details

<ul>
  <li>When the user scans the QR code in the application, there will be an exchange of information in between the merchant and the user. </li>
  <li>The registered user’s name, address, contact number, time and date the QR code was scanned will be saved in the merchant’s log of customers, sorted by date and time. </li>
  <li>The registered merchant’s business name, address, and contact number will be saved in the user’s scanned logs, sorted by date and time the QR code was scanned. </li>
  <li>If a person is tested positive for COVID 19 and went into an establishment, the merchant would simply have to check the logs and provide the information of customers who would have probably contacted the infected person in the given date and time. </li>
  <li>If a registered user has tested positive for COVID 19, it will be easy to check the places the person has gone into prior to being tested. </li>
</ul>
